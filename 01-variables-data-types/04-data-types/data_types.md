# Data types in JavaScript

There are two types of data types.

### 1. Primitive Data Types

a. **String** - Sequence of Characters. Must be in quotes or backticks
b. **Number** - Integers as well as floating-point numbers
c. **Boolean** - Logical entity / True or False
d. **Null** - Intentional absence of any object value
e. **Undefined** - A variable that has not yet been defined / assigned
f. **Symbol** - Built-in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol
g. **Biging** - Numbers that are greater than the "Number" type int

### 2. Reference Types (Objects)

References types or "objects" are non-primitive value and when assigned to a variable,
the variable is given a reference to that value.

Objects literals, arrays and functions are all references types
